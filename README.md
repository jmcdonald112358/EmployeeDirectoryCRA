### Description
This project is a simple web application for viewing basic details about a list of users/employees. It is currently set up with a generic random user generator API, but can easily be reconfigured to make an API call to a specific collection of users. The app allows you to easily see all of your users at a glance, with their relevant details (which can also be reconfigured to whichever specific fields are desired), with the ability to search for a specific user if needed.

### Accreditations
- Create React App npm package for basic code setup
- Referenced most all of week 19 activities
- General Google searching and StackOverflow for assistance working through specific issues (learning how to use `react-bootstrap` npm package, etc.)

### Additional notes / coming soon
- Functionality for resetting a search query will be incorporated soon
- A fix for the footer attribution of source data will be coming soon
    - Currently, the attribution doesn't stay put at the bottom on smaller screens and ends up overlaying page content and just generally looks shoddy
- I had issues with deployment of this, so, there are two repos for it -- one that has the full commit history from working on the project, the other that has copies of the finalized files from the original repo, added with the `gh-pages` integration to get the deployment working.
